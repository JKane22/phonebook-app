# PhoneBook App with ReactJS + TailwindCSS

## What did I learn with this Project?
In this project I learned way better ways of moving things with React with <code>my-[1-99] & mx-[1-99]</code> this makes it much easier to one move things around and two it doesnt effect anything else!

I also learned how to check if that number is already in the Array and if so throw a error to the user letting them know!
## Feature updates for this Project?
- I plan on adding a Edit feature for each of the Todo's that allows you to edit the Title of the Task!
- I plan on adding a Read more if the Text is too long
